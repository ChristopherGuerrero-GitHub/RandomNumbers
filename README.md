# RandomNumbers
Initialize project RandomNumbers - Instantiating the use of the Random class

This program was created to use the Random class and 
instantiate a Random object and pass an integer value of 
6 since that will represent the number of unique sides of
a single rolling dice. A for loop is set to 100 and a
primitive data variable of countDoubles is used to accumulate
the total of matching values between two dices.
